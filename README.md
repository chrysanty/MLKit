Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a study of computational algorithms that improve automatically through experiences. It can be said that ML is a subset of artificial intelligence. Related to computational statistics, machine learning focuses on making predictions using computers. It can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so by using various approaches so it will reduce time on programming things.

There are some things which can be done better by using ML : 
1. Reduce time programming
2. Customize and scale products
3. Complete seemingly "unprogrammable" tasks
