<h1>Machine Learning Kit</h1>

Machine learning (ML) is a study of computational algorithms that improve automatically through experiences. It can be said that ML is a subset of artificial intelligence. Related to computational statistics, machine learning focuses on making predictions using computers. It can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so by using various approaches so it will reduce time on programming things.

<b>There are some things which can be done better by using ML :</b>
1. Reduce time programming
2. Customize and scale products
3. Complete seemingly "unprogrammable" tasks

In this section, I would like to tell my exploration result about one of Google Developer Products, <b>Machine Learning Kit</b>. 

ML Kit is a mobile software development kit that brings Google's on-device machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps. There are many challenges and new UX creation which can be solved by using Vision and Natural Language APIs. All are powered by Google's leading machine learning models.
ML Kit brings Google's machine learning expertise to mobile developers in a powerful and easy-to-use package. By using this kit, your iOS and Android apps will be more engaging, personalized, and helpful with solutions that are optimized to run on device.

<b>The advantages of using ML Kit : </b>
1. Optimized for mobile
2. Built with google expertise
3. Easy to use

<b>Vision APIs</b>

Video and image analysis APIs to label images and detect barcodes, text, faces, and objects.
1. Barcode scanning
2. Face detection
3. Image labeling
4. Object detection and tracking
5. Text recognition
6. Digital Ink Recognition
7. Pose detection

<b>Natural Language APIs</b>

Natural language processing APIs to identify and translate between 58 languages and also provide reply suggestions.
1. Language ID
2. On-device translation
3. Smart Reply
